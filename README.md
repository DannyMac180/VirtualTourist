# VirtualTourist

The fifth project from Udacity's iOS Nanodegree, VirtualTourist downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

What did I learn while building this app?

- How to use NSURLSessions to interact with a public restful API
- How to create a user interface that intuitively communicates network activity and download progress
- How to store media on the device file system Use Core Data for local persistence of an object structure
